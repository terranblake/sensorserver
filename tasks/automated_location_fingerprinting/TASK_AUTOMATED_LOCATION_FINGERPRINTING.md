# **Task: Implement Automated Location Fingerprinting via Clustering**

## **Overview**

Implement an automated process to generate location fingerprints by applying clustering techniques to historical network scan data. The system will group similar network environments (fingerprints) into clusters, which represent potential distinct physical locations. Existing manual annotations will be used to automatically assign labels to these clusters where possible. This reduces the need for extensive manual annotation for initial fingerprint creation and allows the system to discover locations based on observed network patterns. The automatically generated and labeled fingerprints will then be used for real-time location inference.

## **Requirements**

* Process historical raw network scan data (android.sensor.wifi\_scan, android.sensor.network\_scan) to extract timestamped network fingerprints (list of visible networks with RSSI).  
* Implement a clustering algorithm to group similar network fingerprints. The similarity metric should be based on the presence/absence of networks and the difference in RSSI values.  
* Automatically assign location labels to clusters by associating cluster timestamps with manual annotations from event\_data.log. A cluster should be labeled if a significant portion of the scans within it are temporally close to annotations for a specific location.  
* Calculate representative statistics (e.g., median RSSI, standard deviation of RSSI) for each network within each identified cluster.  
* Store the automatically generated clusters and their calculated fingerprints (including consistency metrics).  
* Integrate the automatically generated fingerprints into the real-time location inference system.  
* Implement a reporting or output mechanism to visualize/list the identified clusters, their associated networks/fingerprints, and assigned labels for manual review and validation. This tool should also provide metrics related to cluster distinctness and internal consistency.  
* Identify clusters that may represent transition zones or areas with high signal variability based on intra-cluster variance.

## **Design**

The system will operate in two main phases: an offline calibration/clustering phase and an online inference phase.

**Offline Calibration/Clustering Phase (Automated Fingerprinting):**

* Periodically (e.g., as a batch job), load a significant amount of recent raw network scan data.  
* Extract network fingerprints from each scan, representing the set of visible networks and their RSSI values at that moment. A fingerprint can be represented as a dictionary mapping (type, id) to RSSI.  
* **Define a similarity or distance metric between two network fingerprints.** This metric quantifies how "alike" two network scan observations are. A common approach is a weighted Euclidean distance or a custom metric that accounts for:  
  * **RSSI Differences:** For networks present in *both* fingerprints, the difference in their RSSI values contributes to the distance. A squared difference (rssi1 \- rssi2)^2 is often used to penalize larger differences more heavily.  
  * **Presence/Absence:** Networks present in one fingerprint but *not* the other contribute a penalty to the distance. This penalty could be a fixed value or related to the expected signal strength if the network *were* present (e.g., a large negative RSSI like \-100 dBm).  
  * **Weighting (Optional but Recommended):** You could weight the contribution of each network to the distance based on its signal strength or consistency. For instance, a network with a strong, stable signal (low standard deviation) might have its RSSI difference weighted more heavily than a weak, erratic signal.  
* Apply a clustering algorithm (e.g., DBSCAN, Affinity Propagation, or K-Means if the number of locations can be estimated or iterated) to group similar fingerprints based on the defined metric. DBSCAN might be suitable as it doesn't require specifying the number of clusters beforehand and can identify noise (outlier scans that don't belong to any clear location).  
* For each identified cluster:  
  * Calculate the median RSSI and standard deviation of RSSI for each network within that cluster. This forms the cluster's representative fingerprint.  
  * Examine the timestamps of the scans within the cluster. Find corresponding manual annotations in event\_data.log that fall within or near the time range covered by the cluster.  
  * Implement logic to assign a location label based on the most frequent annotation associated with the cluster. Handle cases with conflicting or no annotations.  
* Store the resulting labeled and unlabeled clusters, their representative fingerprints (median, std dev per network), and associated metadata (e.g., number of scans in cluster, time range covered, average intra-cluster distance).

**Online Inference Phase:**

* The real-time inference system will load the latest set of automatically generated and manually reviewed/labeled cluster fingerprints.  
* When a new real-time network scan arrives, calculate its similarity/distance to the representative fingerprint of each known cluster (location) using the same distance metric defined above.  
* Predict the location based on the cluster with the lowest distance (highest similarity).  
* **Confidence Indicator:** The similarity/distance score itself can serve as a basis for a confidence indicator. A very low distance to the best-matching cluster, especially if that cluster is significantly closer than the second-best match, indicates higher confidence in the prediction. This could be visualized with a loading bar or similar UI element in your application.  
* Optionally incorporate relative positions into the prediction process to smooth transitions.

**Manual Review and Refinement:**

* A separate component (e.g., a command-line tool or a simple web interface) will display the results of the clustering.  
* For each cluster, show:  
  * The assigned label (if any).  
  * The representative network fingerprint (list of networks, median RSSI, std dev).  
  * A list of associated annotations (if any).  
  * Metrics like the number of scans in the cluster, the time range, and an internal consistency score (e.g., average intra-cluster distance, proportion of high std dev networks).  
* Allow the user to:  
  * Confirm or correct labels.  
  * Manually merge or split clusters.  
  * Mark clusters as transition areas or outliers.  
* The system should use the manually refined cluster data for subsequent real-time inference.

**⚠️ DESIGN REVIEW CHECKPOINT**: Before proceeding to implementation, please confirm this design approach.

## **Implementation Plan**

1. **Set up Data Loading and Initial Processing:**  
   * **1.1.** Create a script or module for the automated fingerprinting process.  
   * **1.2.** Implement a function to load all entries from raw\_data.log.  
   * **1.3.** Implement a function to load all entries from event\_data.log.  
   * **1.4.** Implement robust timestamp parsing for both raw and event data logs. Handle potential format variations or errors.  
   * **1.5.** Filter raw data entries to include only network scan types (android.sensor.wifi\_scan, android.sensor.network\_scan).  
   * **1.6.** Extract network fingerprints from each filtered raw scan entry. Represent each fingerprint as a dictionary mapping a unique network identifier (e.g., (type, id)) to its RSSI value at that timestamp.  
2. **Implement Fingerprint Similarity Metric:**  
   * **2.1.** Create a function calculate\_fingerprint\_distance(fingerprint1, fingerprint2) that takes two fingerprint dictionaries as input.  
   * **2.2.** Inside the function, iterate through the network IDs present in fingerprint1.  
   * **2.3.** If a network ID is also in fingerprint2, calculate the squared difference of their RSSI values and add it to a running distance score.  
   * **2.4.** If a network ID is in fingerprint1 but not fingerprint2, add a predefined penalty to the distance score.  
   * **2.5.** Iterate through the network IDs present in fingerprint2 that were not in fingerprint1. Add a predefined penalty for these "extra" networks.  
   * **2.6.** (Optional Enhancement) Implement weighting within the distance calculation based on network characteristics (e.g., using pre-calculated global consistency metrics if available, or simply weighting stronger signals more).  
   * **2.7.** Return the total calculated distance score.  
3. **Implement Clustering Algorithm:**  
   * **3.1.** Choose a clustering algorithm implementation (e.g., use sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN if using Python).  
   * **3.2.** Prepare the data for clustering: create a list of all extracted network fingerprints.  
   * **3.3.** Apply the chosen clustering algorithm to the list of fingerprints using the calculate\_fingerprint\_distance function as the distance metric (or ensure the algorithm supports a precomputed distance matrix if needed).  
   * **3.4.** Handle the output of the clustering algorithm, which will assign a cluster ID to each fingerprint (or mark it as noise).  
4. **Cluster Analysis and Automatic Labeling:**  
   * **4.1.** Group the original raw network scan entries (with timestamps and extracted fingerprints) by their assigned cluster ID.  
   * **4.2.** For each identified cluster:  
     * **4.2.1.** Collect all RSSI values for each unique network ID within that cluster.  
     * **4.2.2.** Calculate the median RSSI and standard deviation of RSSI for each network ID within this cluster. Store these as the cluster's representative fingerprint data.  
     * **4.2.3.** Collect all timestamps of the raw scans belonging to this cluster. Determine the overall time range covered by the cluster.  
     * **4.2.4.** Load the annotated event entries from event\_data.log.  
     * **4.2.5.** For each scan timestamp within the cluster, find any manual annotations from event\_data.log that are temporally close (within a defined time window, e.g., 30 seconds).  
     * **4.2.6.** Extract location labels from the descriptions of the nearby annotations (re-use or refine the extract\_location\_from\_description logic).  
     * **4.2.7.** Determine the most frequent location label among the associated annotations for this cluster.  
     * **4.2.8.** Assign this most frequent label to the cluster if it meets a confidence threshold (e.g., appears in \> 50% of associated annotations). If no clear majority or no associated annotations, mark the cluster as 'Unlabeled' or 'Ambiguous'.  
5. **Store Cluster Fingerprints and Metadata:**  
   * **5.1.** Design a data structure (e.g., a list of dictionaries) to store the clustering results. Each entry should represent a cluster and include:  
     * A unique Cluster ID.  
     * The assigned Location Label (or 'Unlabeled').  
     * The representative fingerprint (dictionary of (type, id) to {'median\_rssi': ..., 'std\_dev\_rssi': ...}).  
     * Count of scans in the cluster.  
     * Time range covered by the cluster.  
     * List of associated manual annotation timestamps and descriptions.  
     * (Optional) Consistency metrics like average intra-cluster distance.  
   * **5.2.** Implement functions to save this data structure to a persistent file (e.g., JSON) and load it.  
6. **Update Real-time Inference:**  
   * **6.1.** Modify the real-time inference component to load the stored cluster fingerprints instead of building fingerprints directly from annotated events.  
   * **6.2.** Update the predict\_location function to calculate the distance between the current real-time network scan's fingerprint and the representative fingerprint of *each* loaded cluster using the calculate\_fingerprint\_distance function.  
   * **6.3.** The prediction logic now selects the cluster with the minimum distance.  
   * **6.4.** Return the Location Label associated with the best-matching cluster.  
   * **6.5.** Implement the confidence score calculation: Based on the minimum distance and potentially the distance to the second-best cluster, calculate a confidence level (e.g., a value between 0 and 1).  
7. **Implement Reporting/Review Tool:**  
   * **7.1.** Create a separate script or interface application.  
   * **7.2.** Implement logic to load the stored cluster data.  
   * **7.3.** Display the list of clusters, showing their ID, label, number of scans, time range, and a summary of the representative fingerprint (e.g., top N networks with median/std dev).  
   * **7.4.** For each cluster, display the list of associated manual annotations.  
   * **7.5.** (Future Enhancement) Implement UI elements or commands to allow manual review, correction of labels, merging/splitting clusters, and marking clusters as noise/transitions.  
8. **Implement Consistency Assessment and Suggestions:**  
   * **8.1.** Within the cluster analysis (Step 4\) or as a separate process, calculate metrics that indicate cluster consistency (e.g., the average distance of scans *to* the cluster centroid, or the proportion of networks within the cluster that have a high standard deviation).  
   * **8.2.** In the Reporting/Review Tool (Step 7), display these consistency metrics for each cluster.  
   * **8.3.** Implement logic to identify clusters that fall below a consistency threshold or have a high proportion of inconsistent networks.  
   * **8.4.** In the Reporting/Review Tool, highlight these clusters and provide suggestions to the user about adding more consistent network sources in the corresponding physical locations.

**⚠️ IMPLEMENTATION REVIEW CHECKPOINT**: After outlining implementation details but before writing code.

## **Technical Constraints**

* The performance and accuracy of clustering depend heavily on the quality, quantity, and diversity of the raw network scan data.  
* Choosing and tuning the clustering algorithm and the fingerprint similarity metric can be complex and may require experimentation.  
* Determining the "correct" number of clusters (locations) automatically is difficult; manual review is essential.  
* Handling dynamic network environments (APs changing, new devices) requires a strategy for updating or re-running the clustering periodically.  
* The accuracy of automatic labeling depends on having sufficient manual annotations that clearly correspond to distinct clusters.  
* Clusters might not perfectly map to human-defined room boundaries.  
* Requires sufficient processing power on the server to perform clustering on potentially large datasets.  
* Defining a robust confidence metric from similarity scores may require experimentation and tuning.  
* The effectiveness of the consistency-based suggestions depends on setting appropriate thresholds for standard deviation and other metrics.

## **Testing Strategy**

* Unit tests:  
  * Test the fingerprint extraction logic.  
  * Test the fingerprint similarity metric with various pairs of fingerprints (identical, slightly different, very different), ensuring penalties and weighting are applied correctly.  
  * Test the logic for calculating median and standard deviation within a cluster.  
  * Test the logic for automatically assigning labels based on annotations, including cases with conflicting or no annotations.  
  * Test the confidence score calculation based on similarity scores.  
* Integration tests:  
  * Run the clustering process on a dataset with known locations (based on your annotations) and visually inspect if the clusters correspond to those locations in the reporting tool.  
  * Test the real-time inference using the automatically generated fingerprints and compare predictions to known locations, observing the calculated confidence scores.  
  * Test the consistency assessment metrics to ensure they correctly identify clusters with high RSSI variability.  
* Manual verification:  
  * Review the output of the clustering and labeling process using the reporting tool.  
  * Manually assess the quality of the generated fingerprints and labels.  
  * Provide feedback via manual adjustments (if the tool supports it).  
  * Observe real-time location predictions and their associated confidence levels, comparing them to your actual location and perceived confidence.
